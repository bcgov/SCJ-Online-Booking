Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
The Application for Written Submissions (CV-AWS) has been booked for the Hearing Date noted below.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of booking the Hearing Date is to identify the date that the partiesâ€™ materials will
be sent to the judge or master and to set the timeframe for submitting materials to the Court.
You will not attend at Court on the Hearing Date.<br/>
<br/>
Please follow the directions set in the document below for next steps:<br/>
https://www.bccourts.ca/supreme_court/documents/sc/Notice_re_Written_Submissions_04.27.20(FINAL).pdf<br/>
<br/>
Please note that you must submit your Written Submissions Brief by email to Supreme Court Scheduling no
later than 4 p.m. on the business day that is one full business day before the Hearing Date.<br/>
<br/>
If you do not do so, your CV-AWS will not be considered by a judge or master. The Hearing Date will be
removed from the list, and the parties will need to start the process over if they wish to have a CV-AWS
considered.<br/>
