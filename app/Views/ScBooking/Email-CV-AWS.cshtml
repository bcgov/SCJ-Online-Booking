Thank you.

The Application for Written Submissions (CV-AWS) has been booked for the Hearing Date noted below.

The purpose of booking the Hearing Date is to identify the date that the parties’ materials will be sent to the judge or master and to set the timeframe for submitting materials to the Court. You will not attend at Court on the Hearing Date.

Please follow the directions set in the document below for next steps:
https://www.bccourts.ca/supreme_court/documents/sc/Notice_re_Written_Submissions_04.27.20(FINAL).pdf

Please note that you must submit your Written Submissions Brief by email to Supreme Court Scheduling no later than 4 p.m. on the business day that is one full business day before the Hearing Date.

If you do not do so, your CV-AWS will not be considered by a judge or master. The Hearing Date will be removed from the list, and the parties will need to start the process over if they wish to have a CV-AWS considered.
